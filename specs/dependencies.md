## Overview

This document maps task dependencies and identifies parallelization opportunities across the development team. It enables efficient resource allocation and workflow optimization by clearly defining what work can proceed simultaneously and what requires sequential execution.

## Dependency Types

### Blocking Dependencies
**Definition**: Tasks that cannot start until prerequisite tasks are completed
**Impact**: Creates critical path constraints
**Management**: Requires careful sequencing and coordination

### Non-Blocking Dependencies
**Definition**: Tasks that can start with assumptions, validated later
**Impact**: Enables parallel work with managed risk
**Management**: Assumption tracking and validation checkpoints

### Soft Dependencies
**Definition**: Tasks that benefit from coordination but can proceed independently
**Impact**: Improves quality when coordinated, acceptable risk if not
**Management**: Communication and periodic sync points
