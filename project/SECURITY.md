We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send a detailed report to: [security@your-project.com] *(Update this email)*
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the vulnerability

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours, we will acknowledge receipt of your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days, we will provide an initial assessment and expected timeline
- **Resolution**: We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will coordinate with you on disclosure timing

### Security Update Process

1. Security patches are prioritized over feature development
2. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed immediately
3. Updates are released as soon as patches are tested
4. Security advisories are published for significant vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

### Code Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Dependency Security
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- Review dependency licenses for compatibility
- Use tools like `npm audit` or `pip check` to scan for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds

### Infrastructure Security
- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Implement rate limiting for APIs
- Use secure headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly review and rotate access credentials

## Security Tools

This project uses several tools to maintain security:

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Detect secrets and security issues before commit
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates for security patches
- **Code scanning**: Static analysis for vulnerability detection
- **Security linting**: Language-specific security checks
