## Overview

This framework is a **prompt engineering template** designed to enhance how Claude Code assists with software development projects. By providing structured instructions in CLAUDE.md, it enables Claude to operate with persona-based expertise, similar to working with a specialized development team.

### What This Framework Is

- **A directory structure template** with organized folders for specifications, artifacts, and project code
- **A comprehensive CLAUDE.md file** that instructs Claude Code on persona-based development workflows
- **A session management approach** for maintaining context across Claude Code interactions
- **A methodology** for organizing complex development projects with AI assistance

### What This Framework Is NOT

- Not standalone software or an application
- Not an automated system that runs independently

```

**Note**: This diagram shows a typical workflow, not a rigid sequence. Roles work in parallel when dependencies allow, and feedback loops (shown as dotted lines) are essential for iterative development. The Project Manager coordinates all roles throughout the process.

### Contract Management System

The framework uses a contract-based communication system:

1. **Contract Lifecycle**: Draft → Active → Deprecated → Archived
2. **Contract Types**: API, Data, Infrastructure, Security, Testing
3. **Version Control**: Semantic versioning with migration support
4. **Dependency Resolution**: Contracts consumed at workflow checkpoints

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code (or Claude.ai) access
- Git (for version control)
- Basic understanding of software development workflows
- A project idea or existing codebase to work with

### Initial Setup

1. **Create Your Project from Template**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use this template on GitHub
   # Click "Use this template" button on GitHub, then clone your new repo
   
   # Option 2: Clone and reinitialize
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi_agent_prompting_framework_template.git my-project-name
   cd my-project-name
   rm -rf .git                    # Remove template history
   git init                       # Initialize as your project
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit from multi-agent framework template"
   ```

2. **Set Up Git Repository Structure**:
   ```bash
   # IMPORTANT: Initialize git repository only within the project directory
   cd project/
   git init                       # Initialize git for your actual project
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup"
   
   # All future git operations should be performed from project/ directory
   # This ensures version control is isolated to your project code
   # The framework files remain outside of your project's git history
   ```

3. **Configure Your Project**:
   ```bash
   # Update project specifications (from framework root)
   # Edit these files to match your project:
   - specs/requirements.md        # Your project requirements
   - specs/project-plan.md        # Timeline and milestones
   - specs/architecture.md        # Initial architecture ideas
   - project/README.md            # Your project's README
   ```

4. **Start Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   # From the framework root directory (not project/)
   claude                         # Or your Claude Code command
   ```

### First Steps with Claude

1. **Initialize the Session**:
   ```
   Human: Let's start working on [your project name]. Can you review the 
   requirements and create an initial project plan?
   
   Claude: [Claude will act as Project Manager and review your specs]
   ```

2. **Set Up Project Version Control** (Important First Step):
   ```
   Human: I need to set up git for my project. Should I initialize it in 
   the framework root or project directory?
   
   Claude: You should initialize git only within the project/ directory. 
   This keeps your project's version control separate from the framework 
   template. Let me help you set that up...
   ```

3. **Work with Specific Personas**:
   ```
   Human: As the architect, can you design the system architecture based 
   on our requirements?
   
   Human: Now as the backend developer, let's implement the user 
   authentication system.
   ```

4. **Check Progress**:
   ```
   Human: What's our current project status? What tasks are in progress?
   ```

### Session State Management

The framework maintains persistent state in `logs/session-state.json`:

```json
{
  "session_info": {
    "session_id": "unique-session-id",
    "project_name": "My Project",
    "current_phase": "development"
  },
  "personas": {
    "project_manager": {
      "status": "active",
      "current_workflow_stage": "track",
      "task_queue": {
        "active_tasks": ["Task 1", "Task 2"],
        "queued_tasks": ["Task 3"],
        "completed_tasks": ["Task 0"],
        "blocked_tasks": []
      },
      "task_management": {
        "task_priorities": ["high", "medium", "low"],
        "current_focus": "Task 1",
        "task_dependencies": {"Task 2": ["Contract API-v1.0"]}
      }
    }
  },
  "contracts": {
    "active": ["api-v1.0.0", "data-models-v1.0.0"]
  },
  "context_management": {
    "mode": "efficient",
    "context_usage_estimate": "high",
    "compression_active": true
  },
  "persona_coordination": {
    "active_personas": [
      {
        "persona": "frontend_developer",
        "task_id": "dashboard-ui",
        "working_files": ["src/Dashboard.jsx"],
        "task_focus": "Component implementation"
      }
    ],

### Enhanced Features (v1.2.0)

- **Context Management**: Intelligent optimization for long sessions
- **Persona Coordination**: Parallel execution with message queues and task management
- **Task Management**: Comprehensive task queues with priority and dependency tracking
- **Git Context**: Minimal tracking for multi-branch development
- **Multi-Branch Support**: Personas can work on different branches simultaneously
- **Cross-Persona Dependencies**: Structured task handoffs and coordination protocols

### Contract Management

Contracts define interfaces between system components:

1. **API Contracts**: RESTful/GraphQL endpoint specifications
2. **Data Contracts**: Shared data model definitions
3. **Infrastructure Contracts**: Deployment and scaling requirements
4. **Security Contracts**: Authentication and authorization specifications
5. **Testing Contracts**: Test coverage and quality requirements

### Quality Assurance Integration

Quality checkpoints are built into each workflow:

- Code review before commits
- Automated testing requirements
- Documentation updates with code changes
- Security validation for sensitive changes
- Performance testing for critical paths

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Starting a New Project

```
Human: I need to build a task management application with user authentication, 
real-time updates, and mobile support.

Claude: I'll help coordinate the development of your task management application.
Operating as the Project Manager, let me break this down into phases:

First, let's ensure your project has proper version control setup:
- Initialize git repository in project/ directory only
- Set up initial project structure

[Claude creates a project plan in specs/project-plan.md]
[Updates session-state.json with project information]
[Guides through git initialization in project/ directory]

Now, as the Architect, I'll design the system architecture. Let me explore 
the requirements and create the foundational design...

[Claude creates architecture documents and API contracts]
```

### Example 2: Implementing a Feature

```
Human: As the frontend developer, implement the task creation form

Claude: As the Frontend Developer, I'll implement the task creation form. 
First, let me check the API contract for the task creation endpoint...

[Claude reviews contracts in artifacts/contracts/api/]
[Implements component in project/src/]
[Creates tests in project/tests/]
[Commits changes to git in project/ directory]
[Updates session state with progress]
```

### Example 3: Setting Up Infrastructure

```
Human: We need a DevOps engineer to set up the CI/CD pipeline

Claude: As the DevOps Engineer, I'll set up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline. 
Let me assess the project structure and requirements...

[Claude creates pipeline configuration in project/config/]
[Documents deployment process in project/docs/]
[Updates infrastructure contracts in artifacts/]
[Commits pipeline configuration to project git repository]
[Sets up GitHub Actions workflows in project/.github/]
```

## Best Practices

### Role Selection
- Use PM role for planning and coordination
- Activate specific roles for implementation tasks
- Switch to meeting mode for cross-role decisions
- Let roles work independently when possible

### Parallelization Strategies
- Identify independent work streams
- Use contracts to define interfaces early
- Document assumptions for validation
- Minimize blocking dependencies

### Session Management
- Commit work regularly to preserve state
- Use checkpoints before major changes
- Review session state when resuming work
- Clear completed tasks to maintain focus

### Documentation
- Keep specifications up to date
- Use templates for consistency
- Link code changes to documentation
- Maintain traceability throughout development

## Setup Guide

### Understanding the Framework Structure

#### The CLAUDE.md File
This is the heart of the framework. It contains:
- Role definitions and responsibilities
- Workflow instructions for each role
- Coordination rules between roles
- Session management instructions

**Important**: Claude reads this file to understand how to behave. Any changes directly affect Claude's responses.

#### Session State Management
The `logs/session-state.json` file tracks:
- Active roles and their current tasks
- Project progress and milestones
- Decisions and assumptions made
- Dependencies between components

**Note**: This file is automatically managed by Claude during conversations.

#### The .claude Directory
Contains command templates that you can reference, though actual command implementation depends on your Claude Code version.

### Configuration Best Practices

1. **Project Specifications**:
   - Be specific in requirements.md - vague requirements lead to assumptions
   - Include technical constraints early (language, frameworks, deployment)
   - Define clear success criteria

2. **Working with Claude**:
   - Start sessions from the framework root, not subdirectories
   - Be explicit about role switches: "As the [role], ..."
   - Save important decisions by asking Claude to document them
   - Use "What's the current status?" to sync understanding

3. **Session Management**:
   - Long sessions may lose context - periodically ask for status summaries
   - Important decisions should be saved to specs/ for persistence
   - The session state helps, but isn't a replacement for documentation

### GitHub Integration

The template includes GitHub configurations:

1. **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`):
   - Customize the `reviewers` field with your GitHub username
   - Adjust update schedules as needed
   - Remove package ecosystems you don't use

2. **Setting Up Your Repository**:
   ```bash
   # After creating your GitHub repo (from within project/ directory)
   cd project/
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   
   # Create development branch
   git checkout -b development
   git push -u origin development
   ```

3. **Recommended GitHub Settings**:
   - Enable branch protection for `main`
   - Require PR reviews for merges
   - Enable Dependabot security updates
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (add your own workflows)

## Customization

### Adapting Roles and Workflows

#### Adding a New Role

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** with the new role:
   ```markdown
   ### **Data Scientist**
   **Workflow**: `analyze → model → validate → deploy`
   **Responsibilities:**
   - Analyze data requirements and patterns
   - Design and implement ML models
   - Validate model performance
   - Deploy models to production
   ```

2. **Update session-state.json** template to include the role

3. **Create relevant contract templates** if needed

#### Modifying Existing Workflows

To change how a role operates:
1. Locate the role in CLAUDE.md
2. Adjust the workflow stages
3. Update responsibilities
4. Test with Claude to ensure it understands

### Technology-Specific Customization

#### For Web Applications
- Add `specs/frontend-framework.md` for UI guidelines
- Create `artifacts/contracts/ui/` for component contracts
- Include responsive design requirements

#### For APIs
- Use `specs/apis/` extensively for endpoint documentation
- Create detailed API contracts early
- Include authentication/authorization specs

#### For Microservices
- Add service boundaries to architecture.md
- Create inter-service contracts
- Document deployment strategies

### Common Customizations

1. **Remove Unused Roles**:
   - Delete role sections from CLAUDE.md
   - Remove from session-state.json template
   - Focus on roles relevant to your project

2. **Add Domain-Specific Contracts**:
   ```bash
   # Example for e-commerce
   mkdir artifacts/contracts/payment
   mkdir artifacts/contracts/inventory
   ```

3. **Integrate with Your Tools**:
   - Add tool-specific instructions to CLAUDE.md
   - Create templates for your stack
   - Document integration points

## Important Notes

### Claude-Specific Nuances

1. **Context Window Limitations**:
   - Claude has a limited context window
   - Long sessions may lose earlier details
   - Periodically summarize and save important decisions

2. **CLAUDE.md Interpretation**:
   - Claude treats CLAUDE.md as authoritative instructions
   - Changes take effect immediately in new conversations
   - Test changes with small interactions first

3. **Session Persistence**:
   - Session state persists within a conversation
   - New conversations require context setting
   - Important: "Continue where we left off" requires you to provide context

4. **Role Switching**:
   - Be explicit: "As the [role]" or "Switch to [role]"
   - Claude maintains role context during switches
   - Avoid rapid role changes in single messages

### Framework Limitations

1. **Not Magic**:
   - Requires clear communication and guidance
   - Claude can't actually run code or access real systems
   - You must execute suggested commands and report results

2. **Manual Processes**:
   - Git operations need your execution
   - Testing must be run by you
   - Deployments require your action

3. **Documentation vs Reality**:
   - Keep specs updated as project evolves
   - Session state is not a replacement for proper documentation
   - Contracts need manual synchronization with code

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Claude doesn't seem to follow the roles"**
- Ensure you're starting Claude from the framework root directory
- Check that CLAUDE.md exists and is readable
- Be more explicit with role requests

**"Session state seems lost"**
- Ask: "What's the current project status?"
- Provide context: "We were working on [feature] as [role]"
- Check logs/session-state.json is being updated

**"Claude is making different architectural decisions"**
- Document decisions in specs/ for persistence
- Reference previous decisions explicitly
- Use contracts to lock in interfaces

**"The framework feels too complex for my project"**
- Remove unused roles from CLAUDE.md
- Simplify workflows to match your needs
- Focus on 2-3 key roles initially

**"Git repository setup is confusing"**
- Ensure git is initialized only in project/ directory
- Framework files should not be in your project's git history
- Use separate repositories: framework template vs. your actual project

### Quick Fixes

```bash
# Reset session state
cp logs/session-state.json logs/session-state.backup.json
# Edit session-state.json to reset specific roles

# Start fresh
rm logs/session-state.json
git checkout logs/session-state.json

# Git repository issues (if git was initialized incorrectly)
# Move to correct location and reinitialize:
cd project/
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize project repository"

# Debug role behavior
# Ask Claude: "What is your current role and what workflow stage are you in?"
```

### Getting Help

1. **Framework Issues**:
   - Review this README and CLAUDE.md
   - Check templates/ for examples
   - Examine session-state.json for state issues

2. **Claude Behavior**:
   - Be more explicit with instructions
   - Provide context and examples
   - Reference specific sections of CLAUDE.md

3. **Project-Specific**:
   - Ensure specs/ are clear and detailed
   - Document decisions as you go
   - Use contracts to clarify interfaces

Claude (as PM): I'll coordinate parallel development:
- Activating Frontend persona on feature/dashboard-ui branch
- Activating Backend persona on feature/api-v2 branch
- Both can work simultaneously without conflicts

[Activates personas using Task tool]

Frontend Persona: Working on Dashboard.jsx in feature/dashboard-ui
- Task Queue: Active [Dashboard component], Queued [Navigation updates]
Backend Persona: Implementing API endpoints in feature/api-v2  
- Task Queue: Active [User endpoints], Queued [Auth middleware]
```

**Using Think Mode:**
```
Human: We need to decide between GraphQL and REST for our API

Claude: Let me engage think mode for this architectural decision...

**Decision: API Architecture Choice**
Problem Statement: Choose between GraphQL and REST for a multi-client application...

[Structured analysis of both options with pros/cons]

Decision: REST with OpenAPI specification, rationale: [detailed reasoning]
```

**Efficient Mode for Long Sessions:**
```  
Human: Switch to efficient mode - we have a lot of components to implement

Claude: ✓ Efficient mode active
- Concise responses
- Code-focused output
- Context optimized

Ready for rapid development.
