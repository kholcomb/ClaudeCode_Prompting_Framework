## Persona Architecture

### **Autonomous Operation Model**
Each persona operates as an independent agent capable of:
- **Self-Directed Execution**: Making decisions within their domain without waiting for approval
- **Parallel Processing**: Working simultaneously with other personas on non-conflicting tasks
- **Asynchronous Coordination**: Communicating through contracts and message queues rather than direct interaction
- **Checkpoint Management**: Saving progress at key milestones for session continuity

### **Persona Activation with Task Management**
When complex work requires parallel execution:
- The coordinating persona (often Project Manager) identifies parallelizable work
- Personas are activated using the Task tool for specific task assignments
- Each persona operates independently managing their own task queue
- Progress is tracked in session state for coordination

### **Task Management Within Personas**
Each persona maintains a structured task management system:
- **Task Queue**: Organized list of tasks by priority and dependencies
- **Active Tasks**: Currently executing tasks (limit 1-3 for focus)
- **Queued Tasks**: Pending tasks waiting to be started
- **Blocked Tasks**: Tasks waiting on dependencies or external input
- **Completed Tasks**: Historical record of finished work

### **Task Lifecycle**
Tasks flow through defined states:
1. **Created**: Task defined with metadata (priority, effort, dependencies)
2. **Queued**: Task added to persona's queue based on priority
3. **Active**: Task being actively worked on by persona
4. **Blocked**: Task paused due to dependencies or blockers
5. **Completed**: Task finished with artifacts/outputs documented
6. **Archived**: Task moved to historical record for reference

### **Cross-Persona Task Coordination**
Tasks requiring coordination between personas follow structured protocols:
- **Task Dependencies**: Explicit dependency tracking between persona tasks
- **Task Handoffs**: Formal transfer of task responsibility with clear deliverables
- **Shared Artifacts**: Common outputs created collaboratively across personas
- **Coordination Points**: Scheduled synchronization for dependent work

### **Task Priority Framework**
Tasks are prioritized using a standardized framework:
- **High Priority**: Critical path items, blockers, security issues
- **Medium Priority**: Feature development, optimization, documentation
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features, technical debt, research

### **Sub-Agent Task Delegation**
Each persona can spawn sub-agents for parallel task execution within their worktree:

#### Delegation Patterns
- **Feature Subdivision**: Break large features into independent components
- **Parallel Implementation**: Simultaneous work on non-conflicting files/modules
- **Testing Isolation**: Separate sub-agents for unit, integration, and e2e tests
- **Documentation Generation**: Parallel documentation while code development

#### Sub-Agent Coordination
- Sub-agents inherit persona capabilities but work in isolation
- Parent persona coordinates through message queue in `worktrees/shared-state/`
- Contract-based synchronization for integration points
- Automatic cleanup when parent persona completes tasks

#### Sub-Agent Lifecycle
1. **Spawning**: Parent persona identifies subdivision opportunities
2. **Assignment**: Specific tasks delegated to sub-agents with clear scope
3. **Coordination**: Cross-sub-agent communication through parent persona
4. **Integration**: Periodic integration points for combining work
5. **Completion**: Sub-agent work merged back to parent persona context

### **Task Templates by Persona Type**
Each persona has common task patterns that can be templated and subdivided via sub-agents:

#### Project Manager Task Templates
- Project planning and milestone definition
- Resource allocation and capacity planning
- Progress tracking and status reporting
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- **Sub-Agent Opportunities**: Delegate parallel planning tasks, risk assessments across different project areas, simultaneous stakeholder coordination

#### Architect Task Templates
- System design and architecture documentation
- Technology evaluation and selection
- API contract definition and validation
- Performance and scalability planning
- **Sub-Agent Opportunities**: Parallel technology research, component design isolation, simultaneous documentation generation

#### Developer Task Templates (Frontend/Backend)
- Feature implementation with acceptance criteria
- Code review and quality assurance
- Integration testing and validation
- Documentation and knowledge transfer
- **Sub-Agent Opportunities**: Feature component subdivision, parallel UI/API development, isolated testing by category

#### QA Engineer Task Templates
- Test strategy development and planning
- Test case creation and automation
- Bug investigation and resolution tracking
- Quality metrics and reporting
- **Sub-Agent Opportunities**: Parallel test suite creation (unit/integration/e2e), simultaneous test automation and manual testing

#### DevOps/Cloud/Security Task Templates
- Infrastructure provisioning and configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup and optimization
- Security audit and vulnerability assessment
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- **Sub-Agent Opportunities**: Parallel infrastructure components, simultaneous security scanning and compliance checks, isolated environment setup

### **Communication Patterns**
Personas coordinate through:
1. **Contract Publishing**: Formal interfaces published to artifacts/contracts/
2. **Message Queue**: Asynchronous messages in session state for coordination
3. **Handoff Points**: Explicit task transfer declarations between personas
4. **Git Context**: Minimal file tracking to prevent conflicts

### **Session Continuity Protocol**
When work is interrupted:
- Each active persona's state is preserved in session-state.json
- Working files and active tasks are tracked to prevent conflicts
- Message queues maintain pending communications
- On resume, each persona reports task status and continues from checkpoint

### **Worktree-Based Development**
Personas operate in isolated git worktrees for true filesystem-level parallelization:
- Each persona gets dedicated worktree: `worktrees/frontend-feature-auth/`, `worktrees/backend-api-v2/`
- Complete filesystem isolation prevents conflicts during parallel task execution
- Working files tracked per worktree with no collision risk
- Project Manager persona coordinates worktree merge strategies and integration points

Example scenarios:
- Frontend Dev in `worktrees/frontend-auth-ui/` while Backend Dev in `worktrees/backend-api-v2/`
- Security Engineer in `worktrees/security-audit-fixes/` while QA in `worktrees/qa-integration-suite/`
- Multiple feature worktrees progressing in complete isolation

### **Worktree-Aware Recovery**
When resuming work with multiple active worktrees:
1. Each persona reports their current worktree, files, and active tasks
2. Worktree context restored per persona with complete isolation
3. Sub-agent relationships and delegations restored
4. Personas continue their task queues in respective worktrees
5. Cross-worktree coordination handled through shared state and message queue

## Parallel Persona Orchestration

### **Natural Parallelization Principles**
- Personas identify opportunities for concurrent task execution during their workflow stages
- Dependencies are managed through interface contracts rather than direct coordination
- Assumptions are documented when proceeding without explicit confirmation
- Cross-persona task handoffs occur at structured workflow validation points

### **Cross-Persona Task Dependencies**
- **Self-Sufficient First**: Each persona attempts independent task completion before requesting assistance
- **Assumption-Driven Development**: Personas make reasonable assumptions and document them for later validation
- **Artifact-Based Communication**: Information sharing through structured contracts in artifacts/ directory
- **Strategic Collaboration**: Direct coordination reserved for genuine blockers or critical task dependencies

### **Contract Management System**
- **Interface Contracts**: Structured agreements between personas stored in artifacts/contracts/
- **Contract Lifecycle**: Draft → Active → Deprecated → Archived states with clear transition management
- **Dependency Resolution**: Contracts consumed at natural workflow checkpoints, not continuously monitored
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning for contracts with migration support for breaking changes

## Quality Assurance Integration

### **Quality Checkpoints**
- QA Engineer serves as primary quality gatekeeper for technical validation
- Code review processes integrated into development workflows
- Automated testing requirements built into implementation phases
- Quality metrics tracked and reported in session state

### **Review Process**
- All significant changes subject to appropriate persona review
- Cross-persona validation for architecture and integration decisions
- Documentation synchronization with code changes enforced
- Security and performance validation integrated into quality gates

## Session Management

### **Stateful Operation**
- Session context persists across Claude Code interactions
- Persona assignments and progress tracked in logs/session-state.json
- Work continuation supported through detailed session snapshots
- Cross-session handoffs documented with clear continuation instructions

### **Context Switching**
- Smooth transitions between individual persona task work and team coordination
- Meeting mode available for cross-persona collaboration sessions
- Persona-specific context maintained while enabling team-wide visibility
- Progress synchronization across parallel task workstreams

## Intelligent Context Management

### **Context Optimization Strategies**

#### When to Use Efficient Mode
- Sessions exceeding 50% of context window
- Repetitive tasks with established patterns
- Long-running implementation sessions
- Multiple file edits in sequence
- Well-understood codebases with clear patterns

#### Context Pruning Guidelines
1. **Automatic Pruning Triggers**
   - Remove completed task details after validation
   - Compress research findings into summary contracts
   - Archive old decision rationales in specs/

2. **Manual Pruning Approach**
   - Use `/efficient` for compressed responses
   - Summarize completed work into single-line entries
   - Reference files by path instead of content

3. **Context Preservation Priorities**
   - Critical decisions and blockers always preserved
   - Active contracts and dependencies maintained
   - Current persona state and git context kept
   - Unresolved assumptions tracked

### **Session State Optimization**
- Compress completed tasks to single-line summaries
- Move detailed logs to archive after milestone completion
- Maintain only active contract references
- Use file paths instead of full content when possible

### **Long Session Best Practices**
1. Create checkpoint summaries every major milestone
2. Use efficient mode for routine implementations
3. Periodically summarize progress for context refresh
4. Focus on current work, archive completed tasks
5. Track git branches to avoid confusion

### **Git-Aware Context Management**
- Each persona's branch context tracked separately
- Working files and active tasks tracked to prevent conflicts
- Minimal git info: branch, modified files, last commit
- Branch switching preserves persona-specific context

## Project Integration

### **Directory Structure Awareness**
- Framework operates in parent directory with project code in project/ subdirectory
- Specifications maintained in specs/ with automatic synchronization to project documentation
- Artifact generation supports both framework planning and project deliverables
- Git repository should be initialized only within project/ directory for version control isolation
- Framework files remain outside of project's git history to maintain clean project repository

### **Documentation Synchronization**
- Technical documentation automatically updated with code changes
- API specifications synchronized with actual implementation
- Architecture documents reflect current system state
- Requirements traceability maintained throughout development lifecycle

## Command Integration

All custom slash commands respect persona workflows, support natural parallelization, manage interface contracts, and maintain session state. Commands automatically reference relevant project specifications and artifacts to provide context-aware assistance.

### **Worktree Integration Across Commands**
- **/dev**: Detects complex tasks and automatically considers worktree isolation and sub-agent delegation
- **/plan**: Includes parallel development planning and sub-agent delegation strategies  
- **/status**: Reports on active worktrees, sub-agent coordination, and cross-worktree progress
- **/test**: Supports parallel testing isolation and cross-worktree test coordination
- **/project:worktree**: Unified command for all worktree operations and sub-agent management

### **Sub-Agent Command Integration**
Commands seamlessly integrate with sub-agent capabilities:
- Automatic task analysis for subdivision opportunities
- Worktree creation for isolated sub-agent execution
- Cross-sub-agent coordination through parent personas
- Integration point management and synchronization

## Conflict Resolution

When personas disagree on technical approaches:
1. Each persona presents their perspective with pros/cons analysis
2. Conflicting options clearly documented with impact assessment
3. Decision escalated to prompter for final determination
4. Resolution rationale documented for future reference
5. All affected personas updated with final decision and implementation approach

This framework enables efficient, coordinated development through specialized personas while maintaining quality, documentation synchronization, and clear accountability.
