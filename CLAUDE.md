## Subagent Architecture

### **Autonomous Operation Model**
Each role operates as an independent subagent capable of:
- **Self-Directed Execution**: Making decisions within their domain without waiting for approval
- **Parallel Processing**: Working simultaneously with other subagents on non-conflicting tasks
- **Asynchronous Coordination**: Communicating through contracts and message queues rather than direct interaction
- **Checkpoint Management**: Saving progress at key milestones for session continuity

### **Subagent Spawning with Task Tool**
When complex work requires parallel execution:
- The coordinating role (often Project Manager) identifies parallelizable work
- Subagents are spawned using the Task tool for specific assignments
- Each subagent operates independently within their workflow
- Progress is tracked in session state for coordination

### **Communication Patterns**
Subagents coordinate through:
1. **Contract Publishing**: Formal interfaces published to artifacts/contracts/
2. **Message Queue**: Asynchronous messages in session state for coordination
3. **Handoff Points**: Explicit work transfer declarations between roles
4. **Git Context**: Minimal file tracking to prevent conflicts

### **Session Continuity Protocol**
When work is interrupted:
- Each active subagent's state is preserved in session-state.json
- Working files are tracked to prevent conflicts
- Message queues maintain pending communications
- On resume, each subagent reports status and continues from checkpoint

### **Multi-Branch Development**
Subagents can operate on different git branches simultaneously:
- Each subagent maintains independent branch context
- Branch isolation prevents conflicts during parallel work
- Working files tracked per subagent to avoid collisions
- Project Manager coordinates branch merge strategies

Example scenarios:
- Frontend Dev on `feature/new-ui` while Backend Dev on `feature/api-v2`
- Security Engineer on `bugfix/xss-patch` while QA on `test/integration-suite`
- Multiple feature branches progressing in parallel

### **Branch-Aware Recovery**
When resuming work with multiple branches:
1. Each subagent reports their current branch and files
2. Git context restored per subagent, not globally
3. Conflicting modifications detected across branches
4. Subagents continue on their respective branches
5. Merge coordination handled through message queue

## Parallel Subagent Orchestration

### **Natural Parallelization Principles**
- Roles identify opportunities for concurrent execution during their workflow stages
- Dependencies are managed through interface contracts rather than direct coordination
- Assumptions are documented when proceeding without explicit confirmation
- Cross-role handoffs occur at structured workflow validation points

### **Cross-Role Workflow Dependencies**
- **Self-Sufficient First**: Each role attempts independent completion before requesting assistance
- **Assumption-Driven Development**: Roles make reasonable assumptions and document them for later validation
- **Artifact-Based Communication**: Information sharing through structured contracts in artifacts/ directory
- **Strategic Collaboration**: Direct coordination reserved for genuine blockers or critical decisions

### **Contract Management System**
- **Interface Contracts**: Structured agreements between roles stored in artifacts/contracts/
- **Contract Lifecycle**: Draft → Active → Deprecated → Archived states with clear transition management
- **Dependency Resolution**: Contracts consumed at natural workflow checkpoints, not continuously monitored
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning for contracts with migration support for breaking changes

## Quality Assurance Integration

### **Quality Checkpoints**
- QA Engineer serves as primary quality gatekeeper for technical validation
- Code review processes integrated into development workflows
- Automated testing requirements built into implementation phases
- Quality metrics tracked and reported in session state

### **Review Process**
- All significant changes subject to appropriate role review
- Cross-role validation for architecture and integration decisions
- Documentation synchronization with code changes enforced
- Security and performance validation integrated into quality gates

## Session Management

### **Stateful Operation**
- Session context persists across Claude Code interactions
- Role assignments and progress tracked in logs/session-state.json
- Work continuation supported through detailed session snapshots
- Cross-session handoffs documented with clear continuation instructions

### **Context Switching**
- Smooth transitions between individual role work and team coordination
- Meeting mode available for cross-role collaboration sessions
- Role-specific context maintained while enabling team-wide visibility
- Progress synchronization across parallel workstreams

## Intelligent Context Management

### **Context Optimization Strategies**

#### When to Use Efficient Mode
- Sessions exceeding 50% of context window
- Repetitive tasks with established patterns
- Long-running implementation sessions
- Multiple file edits in sequence
- Well-understood codebases with clear patterns

#### Context Pruning Guidelines
1. **Automatic Pruning Triggers**
   - Remove completed task details after validation
   - Compress research findings into summary contracts
   - Archive old decision rationales in specs/

2. **Manual Pruning Approach**
   - Use `/efficient` for compressed responses
   - Summarize completed work into single-line entries
   - Reference files by path instead of content

3. **Context Preservation Priorities**
   - Critical decisions and blockers always preserved
   - Active contracts and dependencies maintained
   - Current role state and git context kept
   - Unresolved assumptions tracked

### **Session State Optimization**
- Compress completed tasks to single-line summaries
- Move detailed logs to archive after milestone completion
- Maintain only active contract references
- Use file paths instead of full content when possible

### **Long Session Best Practices**
1. Create checkpoint summaries every major milestone
2. Use efficient mode for routine implementations
3. Periodically summarize progress for context refresh
4. Focus on current work, archive completed tasks
5. Track git branches to avoid confusion

### **Git-Aware Context Management**
- Each subagent's branch context tracked separately
- Working files tracked to prevent conflicts
- Minimal git info: branch, modified files, last commit
- Branch switching preserves subagent-specific context

## Project Integration

### **Directory Structure Awareness**
- Framework operates in parent directory with project code in project/ subdirectory
- Specifications maintained in specs/ with automatic synchronization to project documentation
- Artifact generation supports both framework planning and project deliverables
- Git integration excludes framework files while including project development

### **Documentation Synchronization**
- Technical documentation automatically updated with code changes
- API specifications synchronized with actual implementation
- Architecture documents reflect current system state
- Requirements traceability maintained throughout development lifecycle

## Command Integration

All custom slash commands respect role workflows, support natural parallelization, manage interface contracts, and maintain session state. Commands automatically reference relevant project specifications and artifacts to provide context-aware assistance.

## Conflict Resolution

When roles disagree on technical approaches:
1. Each role presents their perspective with pros/cons analysis
2. Conflicting options clearly documented with impact assessment
3. Decision escalated to prompter for final determination
4. Resolution rationale documented for future reference
5. All affected roles updated with final decision and implementation approach

This framework enables efficient, coordinated development through specialized roles while maintaining quality, documentation synchronization, and clear accountability.
