When creating new infrastructure contracts, use this structure:

```yaml
---
status: draft|active|deprecated|archived
version: x.y.z
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
owner: devops-engineer|cloud-engineer
consumers: [list-of-roles-using-infrastructure]
environment: development|staging|production|all
cloud_provider: aws|azure|gcp|multi-cloud
superseded_by: [contract-name if superseded]
deprecation_date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

## File Naming Convention

- `{service-name}-infrastructure-{version}.md` - For infrastructure requirement contracts
- `{environment}-deployment-{version}.md` - For deployment contracts
- `{cloud-service}-config-{version}.md` - For cloud service contracts

Examples:
- `web-application-infrastructure-v1.md`
- `production-deployment-v2.md`
- `kubernetes-cluster-config-v1.md`
